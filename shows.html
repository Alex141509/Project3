      <p>Dragon Ball is one of my all time favorite shows. I grew up watching it as I would wait every week and watch it on tv when it came out on saturday mornings. I have always liked the story and the action that the show has. I will always be a big fan even if I'm old</p>

    <p>Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the newer anime's that has become popular and I would also put it as one of my favorite shows. This anime has alot of violence and action and the animation is really good! The story that it follows is another key piece in which this anime is very good. It has a good plot and that's why I categorize this anime as one of my favorites.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite shows that isn't a anime would be All American. Not only do I like this show because it has to do with football,but because of all of the drama that it hold with it. It is one of the longer shows that I have seen with 5 seasons going on to 6 but the story is still pretty good. I like this show because it gives life a different propective as there are some scenes that are pretty strong and give a strong message to the watcher. Overall I rate it a 10/10</p>

  <section id="the-league">

    <p>One of the older shows that I really like is "The League" This show is about a group of friends who start a fantasy football league, but they will do crazy stuff to become the champion of their league and overall it is a very funny show. I can relate to this show because I also am part of a fantasy football league and I understand the action they take in order to win. I really enjoyed this show and wish it was still on the air, but sadly good things come to an end.</p>
