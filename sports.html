    <h2>Football</h2>

    <p>Football is my favorite sport that I like to watch the most. My favorite team is the Chicago Bears. Although they are a pretty bad football team I grew up watching them and I will continue to support them</p>

    <p>I also used to play football while I was in high school, although my team sucked and we went 2-6 record wise, It was pretty fun to play for the 3 years.</p>

    <h2>Baseball</h2>
    <img src="images/chicagocubsclublogo.jpeg" alt="Chicago Cubs logo">
    <p>When it comes to baseball I am a big of the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs is my hometeam as I grew up on the northside of chicago. Funny enough how I attend school next to the sox stadium. Unlike the Bears the cubs actually are a better team and the 2016 Championship was really great to experience.</p>

    <p>Rugby is not a well-known sport in the United States, unlike everywhere else but I got introduced to the sport in high school, as I was part of the team. I quickly found the sport interesting and now I am pretty knowledgeable about it.</p>
